# jQuery CLI / MUD

This is a command line or MUD interface originally built for a game being developed by @billythekid
and I.

This code was sitting somewhat dormant in a project folder, so if you'd like to make use of it feel free to.

Iâ€™ve stripped out any game specific things, but I have left in placeholder functions for connecting to a server; this can be used to extend commands, and provide tamper proof online functionality.

## Available commands

- time (displays the current time as a unix timestamp)
- print (will print the text that follows on screen)
- about (displays information about this project)
- about-license (displays the MIT license for this project)
- clear (clears the screen)
- history (displays command history. Can be navigated through with up and down arrows)
- h4x0r/1337 (this easter egg command, makees the terminal area look "hackery"... HACK THE PLANET)


## Future

The javascript code is currently very dependant on the HTML.
At some point, I'll make this behave more like a plugin, allowing it to be dropped into an existing interface with greater ease.

## Quirks

As I said this code was thrown together to get us off the ground with a game project.
There are a few quirks and sloppy bits of coding.

E.g. `$(terminal).scrollTop(900000);` yes I know I'll fix this later ;)

Feel free to use this in your project, but please follow the license.
